### Description:
My web application is a character showcase for the game Risk of Rain 2 that allows the user to look at each character and view their abilities and stats, as well as preview their skills in a video. This page is written with only HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and PHP. All videos were recorded by me.
Steam link for game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/


### Home Page:
The home page presents the user with a choice between the nine different characters, clicking on the name will direct them to the specific character’s page. 


### Character Page:
Each character’s page will have a navbar at the top with the home button available to direct them back to the index page. On the left of the page there is a picture of the character with their stats underneath. In the middle there is a list of the character’s abilities with a play clip option for each. On the right there is a video box, that scrolls with the page, by pressing the Play Clip button to the right of the abilities’ titles it will play a clip of the ability being used.
