# Link and Blurb (Journal)

You may insert your link and blurb into this markdown document

**Please include the screenshots in your journal for easy access.**

Make sure you have:

1. URL to instance
2. Comparision between hybrid/native applications
3. Comparision between hybric/cross-platform applications
4. Problems you faced and how you solved them with refences. You can also put knowledge gained to help future programmers.

Make your journal easy to read by putting:

- overview of task (title)
- what you learned or what you did (explanation)
- problems you faced (what did you learn or what problems occurred)
- and how you solved them (explain what you did or how you solved the problem)
- screenshot showing what you learned or what you did
- references (make sure you reference your work!!!)

The journal will be named “\<Pawprint\>Journal” with the corresponding file extension .md

For example: “Abc123Journal.md”

Your journal should be

- clear
- easy to read
- and be of some help

If the TAs are reading it, the journal should guide them through what you learned or what you did and it should show off how much you implemented and explored.

Do not submit a word document or a text file, make sure it is a nicely formatted MarkDown file otherwise you will get points taken off

Make sure your document is easy to read and using correct markdown
