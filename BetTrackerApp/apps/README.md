# Apps

You may insert your compiled application file here.

Usually for android it is an `.apk` or `.aab` file.
Usually for iOS it is a `.ipa` file

**Submit the build code here for the mobile application.**

You will also run the build code on the server, similar to what we did with ng build except we will build with `ionic build`

Use the Ionic Documentation for publishing the app and publishing your code to the server.

**Do not submit the server build code here, that will go on the server**
